# Select to only let the actual core chart areas determine the distance between
# the charts. This gives equal gap between the chart boxes, but you must ensure
# that decorations do not collide since -1 disables collision check for
# decorations, i.e. labels, numbers, titles, etc. that are external to the core
# chart area. In this example we have ensured that there are no decorations
# between the main chart and the side panels.
